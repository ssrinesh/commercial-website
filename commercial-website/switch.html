						<p>The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid console that uses its wireless Joy-Con controllers to support handheld and home console play.</p>
						<h4>History</h4>
						<p>Nintendo had recently lost revenue because the Wii U was a failure. In addition, Nintendo was also losing money against mobile gaming, and they were hesitant to enter this market.</p>
						<p>When evaluating what new hardware they wanted to produce, they "didn't just want a successor" to either the Nintendo 3DS or Wii U, but instead asked "what kind of new experience can we create?". The Switch was designed to provide a "new way to play" that would "have a larger impact than the Wii U". It would enable developers to create new types of games because the console was so unique and difficult-to-copy.</p>
						<p>The Switch was officially released on March 3, 2017 worldwide with an MSRP of $299.99. There were two Switch bundles available at launch, but more themed bundles have been released over time. - Wikipedia</p>
						<h4>Hardware</h4>
						<p>The Nintendo Switch is a hybrid video game console, consisting of a console unit, a dock, and two Joy-Con controllers.</p>
						<p>The main unit of the Switch is the console, a battery-powered tablet-like monitor that consists of an LCD screen measuring 6.2 inches (160 mm) on its diagonal, the same as the Wii U GamePad. The unit itself measures 173 by 102 by 13.9 millimetres (6.81 in × 4.02 in × 0.55 in) and weighs 297 grams (10.5 oz).The LCD screen supports resolutions up to 720p (1280×720 px). The console includes a 3.5 mm audio jack, stereo speakers on the bottom face of the unit below the screen, a USB-C port for charging, and a kickstand on the back side. The unit also includes slots for a game card (cartridge-based media) and a microSD card slot located under the kickstand. The Switch console itself includes three buttons, all on the top of the device, Volume +/- and Power. The console has rails on the side, into which the Joy-Con controllers can be slid to attach them to the Switch unit. An ambient light sensor on the front of the Console adjusts the screen's brightness automatically. - Wikipedia</p>
						<h4>Reviews</h4>

						<p>"The Nintendo Switch is a remarkably ambitious, clever game system concept that manages to live up to its promise of convenient switching between home console and gaming handheld." - PCMag</p>
						<p>"The Nintendo Switch is a fantastic console for all kinds of gamers, even if you're not a Nintendo fan." - Tom's Guide</p>
