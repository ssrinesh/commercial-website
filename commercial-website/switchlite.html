							<h3>Nintendo Switch Lite</h3>
						</div>

						<p>Nintendo Switch Lite is a compact, lightweight Nintendo Switch system dedicated to handheld play. With a built-in +Control Pad and a sleek, unibody design, it's great for on-the-go gaming.</p>
						<h4>History</h4>
						<p>Nintendo's goal with the Switch Lite was to produce a console less than $200, aimed at casual gamers, to compete with gaming services that do not require a dedicated device. To achieve this, Nintendo aggressively negotiated on reduced prices from its component suppliers.</p>
						<p>The Switch Lite was announced on July 10, 2019, and launched worldwide on September 20, 2019 with an MSRP of $199.99. It launched with three colors: yellow, grey, and turquoise. A special Pokemon Sword and Shield branded version of the Switch Lite, launched on November 8, 2019, a week before the game's release. A coral color was released on March 20, 2020 in Japan, and on April 3 in the rest of the world. - Wikipedia</p>
						<h4>Hardware</h4>
						<p>The Switch Lite is a single, self-contained unit, integrating the various inputs and some features of the Joy-Con controller as part of the main unit's hardware. A regular directional pad replaces the four directional buttons on the left side of the unit. The screen is smaller than the full-size Switch at 5.5 inches (14 cm). Overall, the unit is 3.6 by 8.2 inches (9.1 cm × 20.8 cm) and has a reduced weight of 0.61 pounds (280 g). The battery also has a slightly lower capacity, at 13.6 Wh/3570 mAh compared to the Switch's 16 Wh/4310 mAh. Despite the smaller battery, the unit has a longer expected playtime per charge compared to the original Switch model, estimated to last for 3–7 hours of gameplay compared to the 2.5–6.5 hours for the original Switch. This is due to the smaller screen size, the new SoC hardware being used, and the removal of certain power-consuming features such as HD Rumble and the IR camera that are included on regular Joy-Con controllers. - Wikipedia</p>
						<h4>Reviews</h4>
						<p>"By shrinking things down slightly, the Lite’s display actually makes games appear sharper and clearer." - The Verge</p>
						<p>"The plastic that makes up the Switch Lite’s casing has a soft and slightly rough texture to it that’s a joy on the fingertips." - Kotaku</p>
						<p>"The cross-shaped D-pad is a nice improvement over the four discrete buttons on the standard left Joy-Con" - Polygon</p>
